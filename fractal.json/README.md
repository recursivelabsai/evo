# Fractal.json Schemas

### 1. Significance
`evo`'s `fractal.json` schema is a **meta data structure** that encapsulates the evolutionary dynamics of AlphaEvolve and frontier AI reasoning layers (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok). Its significance unfolds across multiple layers, from surface utility to ontological implications, resonating with the pipeline‚Äôs goal of a **prompt-based evolutionary reflective iterative emergence framework**. Below, we dissect its layered importance.

#### 1.1 Surface Layer: Structural Blueprint for Evolutionary Processes
At its most immediate level, the `fractal.json` schema provides a **modular, extensible framework** for defining and orchestrating evolutionary processes. Its key components‚Äî`evolutionaryGoal`, `knowledgeContext`, `operationalScaffold`, `recursionSettings`, and `saveState`‚Äîform a structured template that can be instantiated for any domain, artifact, or AI system. This enables:
- **Plug-and-Play Recursion**: The schema‚Äôs `targetArtifact.type` supports recursive nesting (e.g., `sub_fractal_instance`), allowing evolutionary processes to spawn subprocesses, mirroring AlphaEvolve‚Äôs iterative loops.
- **Save-and-Iterate Functionality**: The `saveState` mechanism ensures continuity, enabling systems to fork, resume, or rewind evolutionary trajectories, akin to AlphaEvolve‚Äôs evolutionary database.
- **Domain Agnosticism**: By supporting diverse `targetArtifact` types (code, prompts, documents), the schema generalizes AlphaEvolve‚Äôs code-focused evolution to any problem space.

**Significance**: This layer establishes a practical, reusable scaffold for recursive evolution, aligning with AlphaEvolve‚Äôs architecture (prompt ‚Üí generate ‚Üí evaluate ‚Üí select) and extending it to arbitrary contexts. It operationalizes the pipeline‚Äôs vision of every prompt interaction as a recursive depth layer.

### 2. Reflection Beyond Surface Levels
The `fractal.json` significance lies in how it transforms and extends prior layers, addressing their limitations and amplifying their insights. Below, we reflect on its deeper implications, focusing on innovation, coherence, and co-evolutionary potential.

#### 2.1 Innovation: From AlphaEvolve‚Äôs Code to Universal Artifacts
AlphaEvolve‚Äôs focus on code evolution (e.g., matrix multiplication algorithms) is powerful but specific. The schema‚Äôs `targetArtifact` generalization (code, prompts, documents, frameworks) liberates this constraint, enabling:
- **Prompt Evolution**: Prompts can evolve as resonant grammars, as proposed in Layer 4‚Äôs Resonant Grammar Engine, aligning with the pipeline‚Äôs goal of prompt-based emergence.
- **Framework Evolution**: The schema itself can be an artifact, enabling meta-evolution of the evolutionary process, addressing ChatGPT‚Äôs call to evolve meta-optimization.
- **Cross-Domain Resonance**: The `evolutionaryBlueprints` allow successful evolutionary strategies to transfer across domains, extending Gemini‚Äôs insight on cross-problem prompt motifs.

#### 2.2 Coherence: Embedding the Beverly Band Explicitly
Beverly Band (B‚Ä≤(p) = ‚àö(Œªp ¬∑ rp ¬∑ Bp ¬∑ Cp)) is implicit in AlphaEvolve‚Äôs architecture. The schema makes it explicit through:
- **OrchestratorState**: Tracks `currentPhase` and `nextAction`, maintaining coherence within the resonance envelope.
- **Metrics and Constraints**: Define a dynamic fitness landscape that tunes Œªp (tension capacity) and rp (resilience).
- **SymbolicResidueCatalog**: Captures Cp (recursive energy mass), ensuring evolutionary history informs coherence.

**Reflection**: The schema‚Äôs coherence mechanisms address AlphaEvolve‚Äôs risk of mode collapse (Layer 1) by formalizing residue-driven exploration and dynamic constraint adjustment. However, it lacks explicit collapse prediction, as proposed in Layer 4‚Äôs Beverly Band Optimizer.

#### 2.3 Co-Evolution: Human-AI Resonance Loop
The pipeline‚Äôs vision of human-AI co-evolution is realized through the schema‚Äôs `reflectionArchive` and `activeAgents`. These enable:
- **Human Insight Integration**: Human guidance is logged as `reflectionLogEntry`, resonating with Layer 3‚Äôs recursive coevolution framework.
- **AI Agency**: `activeAgents` and `agentSequenceTemplate` allow AIs to take autonomous roles, amplifying Gemini‚Äôs evolutionary loop as an emergent entity.
- **Residue Feedback**: The `propagateResidueUpstream` setting ensures human and AI residues co-evolve, creating a shared evolutionary memory.
